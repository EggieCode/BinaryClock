BinaryClock
===========
A program that prints tranparent a binary clock on your display in Windows.
I wrote this program when I a school in a hour of 2, a year of 2 back.

In that time I was fully focussed on Windows apps.

(Sorry, because it is 2 years old, I wrote this program with Dutch commentary)
